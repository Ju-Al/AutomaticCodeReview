 * Travelling salesman problem asks:
 * Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is
 * the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to
 * the origin city?
 * TSP can be modeled as an undirected weighted graph, such that cities are the
 * graph's vertices, paths are the graph's edges, and a path's distance is the
 * edge's weight. It is a minimization problem starting and finishing at a
 * specified vertex after having visited each other vertex exactly once.
 * This is the naive implementation of the problem.
